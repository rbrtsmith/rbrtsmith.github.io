I came across an interesting article on the relevance of jQuery: 
[jQuery’s Relevancy – There and Back Again](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/jquerys-relevancy-there-and-back-again/)
 
I happen to agree, and all to often we just try to be clever and not need 
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/).  While it's important to know what it's doing 
under the hood, there's little point in reinventing the wheel.  
Time = money, both in the initial development and when it comes to maintenance 
and scaling.

Of course jQuery is not always appropriate, you may be using a framework like 
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), 
or just performing very simple DOM interactions.  However under many 
circumstances it is a smarter move to use jQuery than it is to not.
 
We're always abstracting away things, saying you never need jQuery because 
you can write stuff without is the same as saying you should never use Lodash 
or Underscore&mdash;Or any framework for that matter.

Abstractions are very, very useful.  We can all be smart and do things without, 
but that doesn't make us good value to our employers or clients.  Knowing
how and when to use something like jQuery&mdash;that's what is important to know.
