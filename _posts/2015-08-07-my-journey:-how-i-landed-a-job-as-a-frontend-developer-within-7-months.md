I was recently interviewed by [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/).  If you haven't already heard of 
them they're one of the largest online coding schools in the industry, Treehouse is the resource I used right from the beginning and I'd recommend them as the best introduction to web development you'll find online.
In my interview I talk about how I came to discover web development and how I was able to land my 
first time role as a developer within 7 months &mdash; starting almost from scratch.

You can read the full article [here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/robert-relied-treehouse-became-full-time-front-end-developer).

I hope it inspires some of you hobbyists and those just starting out to take the plunge into becoming 
a full time developer.

For those who read the article and are interested to see where it all started - my blog about my time in Nepal can be found [here](http://www.robstravelstuff.com/)

*N.B.* It was two years ago 8At the time of writing) that I became employed now. I will write a post in the coming weeks about progression from employement as a junior and onwards to a more senior level.
