			<h2>My story</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			In 2010 I was working at a McDonald's as a Shift running manager, Like many young
			people of today I wasn't sure where I should head next in my career.  But I knew it wasn't at
			McDonald's.  I realised that I needed some kind of spark, to re-invigorate me and give me some
			ideas.  With that In mind I decided to save up and go and see the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fast forward 12 months and I was on a plane heading to Kathmandu, with the goal of
			climbing upto Everest Base Camp.  I decided to <a href="http://www.robstravelstuff.com/">
			blog</a> about my experience.  This is where I discovered web-design. &mdash; I had tinkered around
			many years before but at the time did not have a clue what I was doing!

		<p>
			While I travelled throughout Asia &amp; Australia I spent a lot of my spare time
			tinkering around with web-based projects.  It was during this time that I decided that I
			wanted to be a Front-end Developer.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Winter of 2013 I arrived in Uppsala, Sweden and after a 
			short time exploring my new surroundings I began the mammoth task of
			properly learning Front-end Development to a professional standard so I could realise
			my goals.  I spent around 10 Hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week doing this.  Within 6 months
			I was working as a Front-end Developer for <a href="http://wasabiweb.se">wasabiweb</a>
			and I am forever thankful for them believing in me despite the fact I'd been
			learning for such a short period of time.
